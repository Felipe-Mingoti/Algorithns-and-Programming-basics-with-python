# Algorithns-and-Programming-basics-with-python
I putted in this repo all the projects that i've  created during the MC102 course at the University of Campinas. It was an introductory course, to learn the python language and so the basics
of programming.

During the course, I learned:
Basic concepts of computer organization. Construction of algorithms and their representation in pseudocode and high-level languages. Systematic development and implementation of programs. 
Structuring, debugging, testing and documenting programs. Problem solving.
